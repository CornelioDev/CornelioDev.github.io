# About-Me Simple Template
This is a very basic "about me" template to use on GitHub Pages or to put
into your domain while your personal website is under construction.

The idea is very simple. It's just a modern way to have a business card.
But online.

## Roadmap

1. Build the static HTML template for the about-me
2. Publish it in GitHub Pages
3. Build a Node.js back-end to manage content
4. Build a backend to create users with their own profile and URL [*ProjectDomain.io/userName*]
5. Make it public
